# The `asv` file format

`asv`, standing for Arrow Seperated Values is a plaintext file format. 
It is intended to be an alternative to csv.

Put simply, all values are seperated by ` -> `, instead of commas.
Spaces before and after the arrow are reccomended.

Commas may be used inside values. They are used to make lists.
